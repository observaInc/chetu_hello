This README describes how to run the sample cordova app.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Install cordova following the instructions at https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/12.x/guide/cli/installation.html

* Check out the code of this repository.  https://github.com/observaInc/chetu_hello

* Install the cordova android platform
```
cordova platform add android
```

* Plug your phone into a USB port on your machine and enable USB debugging.

* Run the android app on your phone.

```
cordova run android
```

There is no reason to run this sample app in Android Studio.  Doing so will include a lot of files that are not needed.  Run it from the command line as shown above!
